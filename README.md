# Propagation-Model

Scripts for basic propagation modelling using Fourier optics. 

Based on Goodman's Fourier Optics book, and Voelz's Computational Fourier Optics: A MATLAB Tutorial.

Used in three separate, simple projects:
- Modelling the effects of Zernike aberrations
- Modelling a few simple optical computing operations (see also Youchao Wang's private fork, which builds on this alot)
- Modelling ZScan measurements on nanoparticle solutions.

TODO:
- Properly implement cut-off for angular spectrum method
- Fresnel and Fraunhofer propagation with 2 FTs
