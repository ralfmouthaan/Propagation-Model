# Propagation-Model

Scripts for basic propagation modelling using Fourier optics. 

Based on Goodman's Fourier Optics book, and Voelz's Computational Fourier Optics: A MATLAB Tutorial.

Youchao Wang has an interesting private repo forked from an earlier version of this code where he has used this code extensively for modelling various optical computing operations.
